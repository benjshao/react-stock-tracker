# Smartfolio

## Overview

Smartfolio is a web-based stock portfolio manager application, built with React. Functionalities include searching and displaying 
stock price trends using time-series data fetched from the Alpha Vantage API, as well as building a stock portfolio and analysing 
its performance. The application is a personal project with the intent to develop my skills using React and other technologies. 
The end goal of this project is to turn Smartfolio into a full-stack application.

## Architecture & Technologies

- **React**, a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components
- **JavaScript**, the project's main programming language
- **HTML & CSS**,  used to style the application
- **Alpha Vantage**,  a third-party stock market API used to query and receive real-time stock data

## Future Steps

Smartfolio is still in development; I am always looking to expand and improve the project. The roadmap for the future of 
this application is as follows,

- **Implement Node.js and Express.js** for server-side scripting
- **Implement a database** for storage and management of portfolio information
- **Implement user authentication** for identication of the user
- **Implement graphical representation of portfolio performance** to expand the application's portfolio manager functionality
